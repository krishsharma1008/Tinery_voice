/**
 * Single source of truth for the OpenAI Realtime session shape we ship to
 * /v1/realtime/client_secrets. Per Codex review (PLAN §14.1):
 *  - field is `output_modalities`, not `modalities`
 *  - cannot request audio + text simultaneously; ["audio"] gives audio + transcripts
 *  - default to `semantic_vad` for natural conversation
 *  - `voice` cannot change after first audio emission, so it must be set here
 *
 * Instructions and tools are intentionally NOT sent at mint time; the client
 * sends them via session.update once the data channel opens, so we can refresh
 * them mid-conversation (e.g. when Google Calendar context arrives).
